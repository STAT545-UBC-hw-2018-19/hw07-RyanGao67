### foofactors

Factors are a very useful type of variable in R, but they can also drive
you nuts. This package provides some helper functions for the care and
feeding of factors.

### Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-RyanGao67/foofactor")
```

### Package structure

-   R scripts for functions are under [“R”](./R)
-   Test scripts are under [“tests”](./tests)
-   HTML generated by vignettes is
    [“hello-foofactors.html”](./doc/hello-foofactors.html)

### Quick demo

-   Binding two factors via `fbind()`:

``` r
library(foofactors)
a <- factor(c("character", "hits", "your", "eyeballs"))
b <- factor(c("but", "integer", "where it", "counts"))
```

-   Simply catenating two factors leads to a result that most don’t
    expect.

``` r
c(a, b)
#> [1] 1 3 4 2 1 3 4 2
```

-   The `fbind()` function glues two factors together and returns
    factor.

``` r
fbind(a, b)
#> [1] character hits      your      eyeballs  but       integer   where it 
#> [8] counts   
#> Levels: but character counts eyeballs hits integer where it your
```

-   Often we want a table of frequencies for the levels of a factor. The
    base `table()` function returns an object of class `table`, which
    can be inconvenient for downstream work. Processing with
    `as.data.frame()` can be helpful but it’s a bit clunky.

``` r
set.seed(1234)
x <- factor(sample(letters[1:5], size = 100, replace = TRUE))
table(x)
#> x
#>  a  b  c  d  e 
#> 25 26 17 17 15
as.data.frame(table(x))
#>   x Freq
#> 1 a   25
#> 2 b   26
#> 3 c   17
#> 4 d   17
#> 5 e   15
```

-   The `freq_out()` function returns a frequency table as a well-named
    `tbl_df`:

``` r
freq_out(x)
#> # A tibble: 5 x 2
#>   x         n
#>   <fct> <int>
#> 1 a        25
#> 2 b        26
#> 3 c        17
#> 4 d        17
#> 5 e        15
```

-   `detect_factors()`

-   The `fdetect()` function checks if a factor is actually a character,
    it basicly checks that if a factor has repeated value in which case
    the factor can be considered as a character

``` r
# This is a factor
factor <- factor(c("m","i","s","s","i","s"))
# This is a character
character <- factor(c("s", "t", "a"))
                      
# return TRUE if it is a factor
detect_factors(factor)
#> [1] TRUE
# return FALSE if it is a character
detect_factors(character)
#> [1] FALSE
```

-   `newreorder()`

-   The `newreorder()` function can reorder the levels of a factor in
    descending order.

``` r
# create a factor as an example
f <- factor(c("a", "b", "c","d"))
# the originally order: "a" "b" "c" "d"
levels(f)
#> [1] "a" "b" "c" "d"
# the reordered order "d" "c" "b" "a"
levels(newreorder(f))
#> [1] "d" "c" "b" "a"
```

-   `newfactor()` Set levels of a factor to the order in which they
    appear in the data.
-   `newrev()` Set levels of a factor to the reversed order in which
    they appear in the data.

``` r
# create a factor as an example
f <- factor(c("b", "a", "c"))
# the originally order of level should be "b" "a" "c"
levels(f)
#> [1] "a" "b" "c"
# the reset levels should be "b" "a" "c"
levels(newfactor(f))
#> [1] "b" "a" "c"
# the reversed levels should be "c" "a" "b"
levels(newrev(f))
#> [1] "c" "a" "b"
```

-   `dfwrite()`/`dfread()`

Functions `dfwrite()` and `dfread()`: functions to write and read data
frames to plain text delimited files while retaining factor levels

``` r
# The basic idea here is that I first introduce a data frame
# Then I reorder the data
# Then I write the data frame to a file
# Then I read the data from the file
# Then I compare the data that I created and the data that I fetched from the file


dataframe <- data.frame(
    first = 1,
    second = 1:100,
    factor = sample(LETTERS[1:6], 10, replace = TRUE)
)

  dataframe$factor <- newreorder(dataframe$factor)

  dfwrite(dataframe, "./test_reorder.csv", "./levels_reorder.txt")
  fetched <- dfread("./test_reorder.csv", "./levels_reorder.txt")
#> Parsed with column specification:
#> cols(
#>   first = col_integer(),
#>   second = col_integer(),
#>   factor = col_character()
#> )

levels(fetched$factor)
#> [1] "D" "C" "B" "A"
levels(dataframe$factor)
#> [1] "D" "C" "B" "A"
```
